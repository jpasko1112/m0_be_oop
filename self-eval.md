# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    It was definitely challenging and i couldn't have done it without my cohort mates.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    I like to give myself breaks about once an hour, for just five minutes. If i get hungry, thirsty etc I'll extend a break if necessary.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    How a class system works and how you can use 'define method' within that class.
